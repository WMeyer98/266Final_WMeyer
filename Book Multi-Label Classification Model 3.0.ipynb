Ken was self-supporting, working as a lifeguard at a Maine island resort, while Sylvia's family stayed as guests of the owners, one summer between years at college. After their summer love affair, they married other people, but rediscover each other later in life. At that time, Sylvia has a son, Johnny, and Ken a daughter, Molly. While Ken and Sylvia renew their love affair, their children begin a romance. Ken becomes a millionaire through his work as a research chemist as his wife Helen spurns him at home, while Sylvia's husband Bart turns to alcohol as his family fortune disappears, and he turns their island home into an inn. After twenty years away, Ken decides to visit the island again, writing Bart to ask for lodging. Ken brings Molly and Helen to the island, and everyone tries to be cordial. But soon old feelings, and tensions, and longings arise in the adults, while the young Johnny and Molly in turn become enamored of each other. Ken and Sylvia fall in love once again. The couple are noticed by Todd Hasper, the steward of the island, who decides to inform Sylvia's husband Bart. Ken, aware of Sylvia's plight, invites her and her family to take over a motel job in Florida for Bart has asked for a divorce and the custody of their son John. The affair between Ken and Sylvia is again noticed, this time by a friend of Helen's. The two divorce, and their daughter Molly, like John, is sent to boarding school. During their tenure at their respective schools, John and Molly begin an avid correspondence. Helen and her mother Margaret are not pleased, as they find it inappropriate for a girl her age to be so attached to a boy. Their correspondence continues, with rendezvous during school breaks. Their romance culminates when they see each other again at Ken and Sylvia's beach house. The two acknowledge that they are in love with one another, and they consummate it shortly thereafter. Back at school, Molly learns from a doctor that she is pregnant, and John hitchhikes across the country to be with and support her. Ken and Sylvia give their guarded approval, feeling hypocritical to deny them their love. Bart, whose alcoholism has landed him in a veterans hospital, cannot attend the wedding, and while he disapproves, he urges John to take over the inn. Helen attends the wedding under sedation. The book ends with John and Molly spending their honeymoon on Pine Island, John's \\\"one good inheritance\\\", as Bart terms it in a letter.\",\n          \" The story begins on Pluto in the distant future. Its inhabitants, former collaborators of the Qax, humanity's erstwhile conquerors, are under attack from the new-formed Coalition, seeking revenge for humanity's enslavement. As such, the inhabitants send five generation ships out of the solar system in the hopes that they will be able to form colonies of their own that can survive the Coalition. Rusel, the protagonist, is admitted onto Mayflower II, one of the ships, at the last minute. Shortly after takeoff, it is revealed that the ship's intended destination is outside the galaxy, requiring a flight time of 50,000 subjective years, even with the effects of time dilation. The ship's captain selects a few individuals to receive medical treatment granting them immortality, allowing them to guide the ship through its millennia-long voyage. Over time, however, these individuals die through malfunctions or boredom, leaving Rusel as the only immortal on board, but he becomes increasingly dependent on life-support and gradually merges with the ship. Over time, the other inhabitants of the ship form several different societies, gradually becoming detached from their original humanity. Eventually, they form an almost unrecongisable tribal civilisation. Having forgotten that they are on a spaceship at all, they only maintain it through religious tradition. After 25,000 years have passed, the Mayflower is contacted by Pirius and Torec (protagonists of Exultant), former soldiers of the Coalition, which is revealed to have fallen. They offer to remove the inhabitants from the ship and care for them elsewhere. Rusel, now completely merged with the ship's systems, allows them to do so. Pirius and Torec then leave Rusel to continue into space without the burden of the crew, which he gladly accepts.\",\n          \" Like the sixth collection, Fables and Reflections, and the eighth, Worlds' End, Dream Country consists of short stories that do not have a common storyline running through them, though it has been argued that most Sandman stories are not entirely self-contained and are part of a larger story arc that encompasses the entire series. Dream Country is the shortest of the eleven Sandman collections, featuring just four issues (\\\"Calliope\\\", #17, and \\\"A Dream of a Thousand Cats\\\", #18, both pencilled by Kelley Jones and inked by Malcolm Jones III; \\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\\", #19, drawn by Charles Vess and coloured for the first time by computer colouring pioneer Steve Oliff; and \\\"Fa\\u00e7ade\\\", #20, penciled by Colleen Doran and inked by Malcolm Jones III). This is the story of a frustrated author, Richard Madoc, whose first book has been released to critical acclaim but who simply cannot write a page of the promised follow-up. He strikes a deal with an elder writer, Erasmus Fry, for Calliope, one of the Muses of Greek mythology, whom Fry had captured earlier in his life, in exchange for a bezoar. Fry kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her, and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels. Madoc also takes her captive and has great success in writing, but Calliope calls upon the triad of witches known by many names, such as the Furies, the Kindly Ones or the Gracious Ladies, for help. They direct her to Morpheus, who we are told was once her lover (this relationship is elaborated on later in the series), and who is currently similarly imprisoned. Upon his release, he comes to rescue Calliope, and visits a terrible punishment upon Madoc. He complains that without her, he will have no ideas, so Morpheus causes him to never stop having them, which drives him to madness. Though the story of \\\"Calliope\\\" was not criticized for unoriginality at the time of its release, its concept has apparently become a very popular one since; a list of overused story ideas at Strange Horizons included \\\"Creative person meets a muse (either one of the nine classical Muses or a more individual muse) and interacts with them, usually by keeping them captive.\\\" (See Neil Gaiman's post about Strange Horizon's list). Madoc's Book \\\"Her Wings\\\" appears in a few other stories by Neil Gaiman including The Last Temptation as a sort of inside joke. Rose Walker is later seen reading Fry's book \\\"Here Comes a Candle\\\". In the library of Dream, an unfinished book by Erasmus Fry, \\\"The Hand of Glory\\\" is seen in Season of Mists. One of Madoc's works, \\\"The Spirit Who Had Half Of Everything\\\", takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of James Branch Cabell's Figures of Earth. This tale begins with a small, white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night. They speak of an event in a graveyard that they don't want to miss. When they arrive, they see that many cats are already there. A Siamese cat comes to tell her story. A long time ago, the Siamese cat relates, she met a Tom-cat, who became her lover. Eventually, she gave birth to several kittens. Her human owners were not pleased, and the male owner put the kittens in a bag bound to a rock, and threw them into pond. Traumatized by the callous murder of her kittens, the Siamese becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet. Her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the Dreaming. In the dream a raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring: a cave inhabited by the Dream Lord. At the entrance to the cave that the raven told her of, many fearsome animals tell her to leave. She responds by saying that she will only state her business to Dream. Inside, she finds Dream in the form of a cat. Dream presents her with a vision of an alternate reality where cats are huge and humans are merely their playthings, tiny servants which groom their bodies and which the cats can kill at their leisure. A man ruined that world by informing the humans that their dreams will shape the world. Enough humans listened to make the vision a reality. Upon waking, the cat undertakes a spiritual quest for justice. She preaches her vision to motley assortments of housecats around the world, hoping that if she can make enough believe in and dream of this reality, the world will change to conform to their dreams. The cat from the beginning of the story heads home. Her friends were slightly disappointed, though they admitted that what they heard was interesting. The white cat, however, was fully taken by the tale. She returns home and heads to sleep. Over breakfast, her owners remark on what a cute stance she's in: it looks as if she's hunting something, or someone. Although seemingly a complete diversion from the basic story of the Sandman, it in fact illustrates some of the core themes of the series: the idea that reality is shaped in the most literal sense by the dreams, beliefs, and expectations of humans (and, in this case, of other animals as well). The story also portrays the theme of change and its relation to an individual's nature. The humans found that they were unhappy with their role and were able to harness the power of dream to instigate a change of the nature of reality, whereas when cats found themselves in a similar situation their apathetic, independent, and fickle nature kept them from changing. This idea of the capacity for change reemerges throughout the book, most notably in the conclusion of The Kindly Ones. !-- This section is linked from Characters of The Sandman --> This is a core issue of the Sandman series, sometimes cited as the best in the series. It concerns the premiere of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which we are told was commissioned by Morpheus as part of a bargain in which Morpheus granted Shakespeare his extraordinary skill with writing. Performed on a hillside before an audience of bizarre creatures from Faerie - including the very characters who appear in the play, Titania, Auberon, and the hobgoblin Robin Goodfellow (Puck) amongst them - the Sandman's version of reality and Shakespeare's play are merged and interact with one another. Puck greatly enjoys the play and repeats the theme of the story that while the play does not directly reflect history or even some of the personalities of the characters it is still considered a true reflection of \\\"reality\\\". (In reality Puck is described as being a psychotic murderer and not a merry wanderer of the night.) Titania takes an interest in Shakespeare's son Hamnet, who plays a small role in the play. The issue received a World Fantasy Award for short fiction in 1991. Dream first meets Shakespeare in Sandman #13, &#34;Men of Good Fortune,&#34; and the final issue, #75, &#34;The Tempest,&#34; focuses on the second of the two plays commissioned by Morpheus. This is another odd issue, featuring one of the methods Gaiman played with in the first, and to a lesser extent in the second, collection: it takes one of the neglected characters from the DC Universe, this time Element Girl (Urania Blackwell, a female version of Metamorpho), and shows her in a completely unexpected situation. A reluctant superhero at best, she has now retired, and lives a meagre existence, rarely leaving her flat due to her self-loathing of her &#34;freakish&#34; appearance. She goes by her nickname &#34;Rainie&#34;. The plot revolves around a phone call she receives: an invitation to have dinner with an old friend, Della. She concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn&#39;t know of her &#34;skin disease&#34;. As Della explains a problem she&#39;s having, Rainie&#39;s &#34;face&#34; falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered, revealing her true face. She runs away, and to her apartment, where she wonders how she can kill herself, despite being invulnerable. Fortunately, Death, who was dealing with a woman who&#39;d slipped on a stepladder, enters her room, explaining that the door was open, and she had heard her crying. She tells her how she can talk to the sun god, Ra, and beg for a merciful death. An extraordinarily poignant piece dealing with identity and, subtly, the gap between the world portrayed in the more na\\u00efve of DC Comics&#39; superhero comics and the true reality of everyday life, it ends on a curiously happy note, with Death answering Rainie&#39;s telephone and informing the caller that &#34;she&#39;s gone away, I&#39;m afraid.&#34;\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genre_list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Exploratory Analysis\n","len(df.index)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AMVcz7f0EPv8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722720265741,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"William Meyer","userId":"07100578814978255474"}},"outputId":"8b3732f5-ebf7-4fe0-d735-b221b71e2b0c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["16559"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Unique genres\n","flattened_genres = [genre for sublist in df['genre_list'] for genre in sublist]\n","\n","genre_counts = {genre: flattened_genres.count(genre) for genre in set(flattened_genres)}\n","\n","# Convert to a DataFrame\n","genre_counts_df = pd.DataFrame(list(genre_counts.items()), columns=['Genre', 'Count'])\n","\n","# Sort the DataFrame by count\n","sorted_genre_counts_df = genre_counts_df.sort_values(by='Count', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","# Print the sorted DataFrame\n","print(sorted_genre_counts_df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7y5lQMlZEyEy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722720265981,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":241,"user":{"displayName":"William Meyer","userId":"07100578814978255474"}},"outputId":"8e4afa4e-eaf6-485f-cb78-d6cf2cbfe674"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["                              Genre  Count\n","0                           Fiction   4747\n","1               Speculative fiction   4314\n","2                   Science Fiction   2870\n","3                             Novel   2463\n","4                           Fantasy   2413\n","..                              ...    ...\n","222  Colonial United States romance      1\n","223                         Collage      1\n","224         Experimental literature      1\n","225                     Pornography      1\n","226         American Gothic Fiction      1\n","\n","[227 rows x 2 columns]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# remove samples with 0 genre tags\n","df = df[~(df['genre_list'].str.len() == 0)]"],"metadata":{"id":"2d7aQOkWGHjS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(df.index)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"37tJeNd-GJdW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722720265981,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"William Meyer","userId":"07100578814978255474"}},"outputId":"e12e39f9-8544-4732-ad06-0193895d42d3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["12841"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Sample 5,000 Records so we predict 1,000."],"metadata":{"id":"SGiri8oWMcUp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["random_seed = 42\n","\n","# Sample 5000 records with the random seed\n","df = df.sample(5000, random_state=random_seed)"],"metadata":{"id":"cBL2rDVVMbn3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **1.0 Bag of Words Baseline**"],"metadata":{"id":"hcwvspahMqem"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","import re\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9WZKQqTiMqPy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# function for text cleaning\n","def clean_text(text):\n","    #

The inhabitants of Labrador have vague historical recollections of the \\\"Old People\\\", a technologically advanced civilization which existed long ago and which they believe was destroyed when God sent \\\"Tribulation\\\" to the world to punish their forebears' sins. The society that has survived in Labrador is loosely reminiscent of the American frontier during the 18th century. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity with post-apocalyptic prohibitions. They believe that in order to follow God's word and prevent another Tribulation, they need to preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans, plants and animals. Genetic invariance has been elevated to the highest religious principle, and humans with even minor mutations are considered \\\"Blasphemies\\\" and the handiwork of the Devil. Individuals not conforming to a strict physical norm are either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed area still rife with animal and plant mutations. Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over sized horses. These are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds either pre-existing or achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier community. The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community, populated with hardy and pious individuals intent on reclaiming land from the Fringes. Ten-year-old David Strorm, the son of Waknuk's zealous religious patriarch, has inexplicably vivid dreams of brightly lit cities and horseless carts that are at odds with his pre-industrial experience. Despite David's rigorous religious training, he befriends Sophie, a girl carefully concealing the fact that she has six toes on each foot. With the nonchalance of childhood David keeps her secret. The subsequent discovery of Sophie's mutation and her family's attempted flight causes David to wonder at the brutal persecution of human \\\"Blasphemies\\\" and the ritual culling of animal and plant \\\"Deviations\\\". David and a few others of his generation harbour their own invisible mutation: they have strong telepathic abilities. David begins to question why all who are different must be banished or killed. As they mature, David and his fellow telepaths realize that their unusual mutation would be considered a \\\"blasphemy\\\" and they carefully conceal their abilities. That their mutation cannot be directly detected allows their unusual abilities to remain undiscovered for a time. Eventually some of the group are exposed and David, his half-cousin Rosalind and younger sister Petra flee to the Fringes. They are quickly pursued not only by a group of villagers bent on doing them harm but also by Michael, a fellow telepath who covertly assists their escape. Through the extremely strong telepathic abilities of Petra they make contact with a more advanced society in distant \\\"Sealand\\\". David, Rosalind and Petra elude their would-be captors and are rescued by a Sealand expedition sent to discover the source of Petra's telepathic transmissions. Due to limited space and fuel on the Sealand craft, Michael and his partner Rachel remain behind, their true nature undiscovered. Though the nature of \\\"Tribulation\\\" is not explicitly stated, it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust, both by the mutations, and by the stories of sailors who report blackened, glassy wastes to the south-west where the remains of faintly glowing cities can be seen (presumably the east coast of the US). Sailors venturing too close to these ruins experience symptoms consistent with radiation sickness. A woman from Sealand, a character with evident knowledge of the Old People's technology, mentions \\\"the power of gods in the hands of children\\\".\",\n          \" Mr. and Mrs. Edward Brookenham host an effete, rather corrupt social circle. They are the parents of worthless Harold and sweet but knowledgeable Nanda (age eighteen). Mr. Longdon attends one of their social functions and is amazed at how much Nanda resembles her grandmother, his long-ago love who married another man. Vanderbank, a young civil servant with little money, admires both Mrs. Brookenham (nicknamed \\\"Mrs. Brook\\\") and Nanda. Mrs. Brook seems to want an affair with \\\"Van\\\" but he appears more interested in Nanda. Mr. Longdon promises him a dowry if he marries Nanda. Mrs. Brook is instead trying to get her daughter married to Mitchy, a very rich but rather naive member of her social circle. But Nanda urges Mitchy to marry Aggie, the supposedly sheltered step-niece of one of Mrs. Brook's friends (the Duchess). Mitchy follows the advice, then watches helplessly as Aggie kicks over the traces and starts playing around on him. Van constantly hesitates about proposing to Nanda.

in the future post apocalypse rural labrador has become a warmer and more hospitable place than it is at present the inhabitants of labrador have vague historical recollections of the old people a technologically advanced civilization which existed long ago and which they believe was destroyed when god sent tribulation to the world to punish their forebears sins the society that has survived in labrador is loosely reminiscent of the american frontier during the th century the inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist christianity with post apocalyptic prohibitions they believe that in order to follow gods word and prevent another tribulation they need to preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans plants and animals genetic invariance has been elevated to the highest religious principle and humans with even minor mutations are considered blasphemies and the handiwork of the devil individuals not conforming to a strict physical norm are either killed or sterilized and banished to the fringes a lawless and untamed area still rife with animal and plant mutations arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over sized horses these are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds either pre existing or achieved through conventional breeding the governments position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox

religious training he befriends sophie a girl carefully concealing the fact that she has six toes on each foot with the nonchalance of childhood david keeps her secret the subsequent discovery of sophies mutation and her familys attempted flight causes david to wonder at the brutal persecution of human blasphemies and the ritual culling of animal and plant deviations david and a few others of his generation harbour their own invisible mutation they have strong telepathic abilities david begins to question why all who are different must be banished or killed as they mature david and his fellow telepaths realize that their unusual mutation would be considered a blasphemy and they carefully conceal their abilities that their mutation cannot be directly detected allows their unusual abilities to remain undiscovered for a time eventually some of the group are exposed and david his half cousin rosalind and younger sister petra flee to the fringes they are quickly pursued not only by a group of villagers bent on doing them harm but also by michael a fellow telepath who covertly assists their escape through the extremely strong telepathic abilities of petra they make contact with a more advanced society in distant sealand david rosalind and petra elude their would be captors and are rescued by a sealand expedition sent to discover the source of petras telepathic transmissions due to limited space and fuel on the sealand craft michael and his partner rachel remain behind their true nature undiscovered though the nature of tribulation is not explicitly stated it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust both by the mutations and by the stories of sailors who report blackened glassy wastes to the south west where the remains of faintly glowing cities can
